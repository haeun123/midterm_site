			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oakland got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William Eichenbaum, who settled there in 1840. The area rapidly developed following the Great Fire of 1845 in Downtown Pittsburgh, after which many people moved out to the suburbs. By 1860, there was considerable commercial development along Fifth Avenue.</p>

			</div>
			<p>In 1868, two years after seceding from Pitt Township, Oakland Township was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh. Twenty-one years later, Mary Schenley gave the city 300 acres in Oakland for a park. Officials bought another 100 acres from her for "Schenley Park." And Mary Schenley gave another gift: land for Schenley Plaza. At Schenley Plaza, industrialist Andrew Carnegie built a library, museum and concert hall complex, which opened in 1895.</p>

				<h5>Carnegie Mellon University's campus</h5>
			</div>
			<p>Oakland has long been considered Pittsburgh's university center. Carnegie Mellon University is the result of a 1967 merger of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, founded in Oakland in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie, and Mellon Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon to conduct industrial research. The University of Pittsburgh, which is heir to the Pittsburgh Academy that was incorporated in 1787, relocated to Oakland in 1909 from its campus that was then in Allegheny. In 1917, Teddy Roosevelt visited the neighborhood.</p>

				<h5>Cathedral of Learning</h5>
			</div>
			<p>Some of the most impressive architecture in Oakland is on Pitt's campus. In 1925, work began on what was then the world's tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Although the Cathedral of Learning is now the fourth-tallest educationally purposed building in the world, it remains the world's second tallest university building, the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, and the second tallest gothic-styled building in the world. Oakland is also home to the university's French-Gothic revival Heinz Memorial Chapel and St. Paul Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. It is also home of the main branch of the Carnegie Library, the Carnegie Museum, and Phipps Conservatory.</p>

				<h5>Forbes Field, before it closed</h5>
			</div>
			<p>Baseball fans might know Oakland for the beloved Forbes Field, which was built in 1909 as the third home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and first home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. While Forbes Field was closed in 1970, some remnants of the ballpark still stand. Pirates fans gather on the site each year on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski's World Series winning home run on October 13, 1960.</p>
